I am a first year PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests are in law, technology, finance, and the downstream effects of these systems on population's wellbeing. Right now I'm interested in surveillance in platform versus traditional organizations in the shipping and warehouse industry. 

Prior to my time here in the East Bay, I was a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School working on The Shift Project and a Research Analyst in the Urban and Regional Economics team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. My training is in math and economics at Ohio State (go Bucks).
