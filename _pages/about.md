## About
I am a PhD student at the Department of Sociology at University of California, Berkeley.

## Interests
My research broadly focuses on how technology is changing work-based inequalities and regulations. I aim to integrate quantiative and computational methods with historical methods to examine the historical determinants of present-day institutions.

## Affiliations
I am currently in the [Political Economy Designated Emphasis Program](https://n2pe.berkeley.edu/political-economy-network-fellows-program/) and am an incoming fellow in the [Computational Social Science Training Program](https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/computational-social-science-training-program). Prior to my PhD program, I was a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School working on [The Shift Project](https://shift.hks.harvard.edu/author/annette-gailliot/) and a Research Analyst in the Urban and Regional Economics team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. My training is in math and economics at Ohio State (go bucks).
