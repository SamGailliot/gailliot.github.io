I am a first year PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests are in law, technology, finance, and the  effects of these systems on population's wellbeing. Right now I'm researching surveillance in platform and traditional organizations in the shipping and warehouse industry. 

Prior to my time here in the East Bay, I was a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School working on [The Shift Project](https://shift.hks.harvard.edu/author/annette-gailliot/) and a Research Analyst in the Urban and Regional Economics team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. My training is in math and economics at Ohio State (go Bucks).
